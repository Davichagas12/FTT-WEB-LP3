<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Proposed by [Daniel Carvalho](https://github.com/danielscarvalho) in the Programming Language III subject at [*Faculdade de Tecnologia Termomecanica*](http://www.ftt.com.br/).

This project is a Netflix Clone, but adapted to be a joke with the term "Full Stack" used by young padawans / programmers to show that they know how to do "everything" even if they don't know it.
